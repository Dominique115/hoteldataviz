  <h2>Overall Research Question</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>How do booking timing and pricing patterns relate to cancellation risk across hotel
    and customer segments?</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>View-specific Analytic Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>View 1:</strong> Do guests who book earlier tend to pay more or less (ADR), and does this relationship differ by guest type or booking channel?</li>
    <li><strong>View 2:</strong> How do payment commitments and customer characteristics interact to influence cancellation likelihood?</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- ===================== VIEW 1 ===================== -->

  <h2>View 1 – Booking Timing and Pricing: Lead Time–ADR Relationship Across Guest Segments</h2>

  <p>
    This view focuses on the relationship between <strong>lead time</strong> (how early guests book)
    and <strong>ADR</strong> (average daily rate), and how that relationship changes across
    <strong>hotel type</strong>, <strong>customer type</strong>, and <strong>distribution channel</strong>.
    It links micro-level booking points with macro-level trends and distributions.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Analytic question.</strong><br>
    Do guests who book earlier tend to pay more or less (ADR), and does this relationship differ
    by guest type or booking channel?
  </p>

  <p><strong>Low-level tasks.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare the distribution of ADR across different lead times.</li>
    <li>Identify whether the relationship between lead time and ADR changes across hotel types.</li>
    <li>Examine how booking patterns differ across customer types and booking channels.</li>
    <li>Filter and highlight relevant subsets of points to explore patterns interactively.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>View design.</strong><br>
    The view consists of four linked components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A scatter plot of <strong>lead_time vs ADR</strong> with brush selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Trend lines</strong> (one per hotel type) summarizing the overall lead time–ADR pattern.</li>
    <li>A <strong>stacked bar chart</strong> showing distribution channels within each customer type, filtered by the scatter selection.</li>
    <li>A <strong>boxplot</strong> of lead time across customer types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All components respond to user selections, and checkboxes for <strong>City Hotel</strong> and
    <strong>Resort Hotel</strong> act as global filters.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Channels and encodings.</strong><br>
    The scatter plot uses position (lead time on the x-axis, ADR on the y-axis) as the primary
    channel to show the booking timing–pricing relationship. Color encodes hotel type and is
    used consistently across scatter points and trend lines. Opacity de-emphasizes points
    outside the current selection, guiding attention to active subsets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trend lines add a derived positional encoding that summarizes the general direction
    of the relationship for each hotel type. The stacked bar chart uses length to represent
    booking counts and color to encode distribution channels. The boxplot uses vertical
    position to compare lead time across customer types, showing variation, median, and spread.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Interaction.</strong><br>
    Two main interactions are implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brush selection on the scatter plot:</strong> dragging across the scatter filters the bar chart; brushed points keep full color and opacity while others fade.</li>
    <li><strong>Point selection on the stacked bar chart:</strong> clicking a bar segment (e.g., “Transient – Direct”) highlights the corresponding points in the scatter plot; other segments remain visible but semi-transparent, supporting multi-selection and comparison.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These interactions create a linked, bidirectional filtering system. Checkbox parameters
    for hotel type provide an additional global filter, updating the scatter, trend lines,
    bar chart, and boxplot simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Critique.</strong><br>
    Overall, this view effectively links individual bookings with aggregated patterns.
    The scatter plot and trend lines help reveal how lead time relates to ADR across hotel types.
    The stacked bar chart supports understanding guest segmentation by channel, although
    category imbalances and some overplotting in the scatter can still make comparisons
    slightly challenging. The boxplot adds structural context for booking timing across
    customer types, even though its connection to ADR is indirect.

  <!-- ===================== VIEW 2 ===================== -->

  <h2>View 2 – Interactions Between Payment Commitments, Customer Segments, and Cancellation Risk</h2>

  <p>
    This view examines how <strong>pricing</strong>, <strong>payment commitments</strong>
    (deposit types), and <strong>customer segments</strong> jointly shape
    <strong>cancellation risk</strong>, with ADR acting as a filter that controls
    the price range under consideration.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Analytic question.</strong><br>
    How do payment commitments and customer characteristics interact to influence
    cancellation likelihood?
  </p>

  <p><strong>Low-level tasks.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare cancellation rates across different deposit types.</li>
    <li>Compare cancellation rates across different customer types.</li>
    <li>Examine how specific combinations (e.g., “Non-Refund – Transient”) differ from others.</li>
    <li>Explore how cancellation risk varies after filtering bookings by ADR range.</li>
    <li>Investigate differences between hotel types using a selectable interaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>View design.</strong><br>
    The view contains two linked visualizations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Histogram + cancellation-rate line chart (Vizz1):</strong><br>
      ADR is binned on the x-axis. Bars show booking counts, with a toggle to switch
      between Separate and Combined bar modes. Lines show cancellation rate per ADR bin,
      one for each hotel type. ADR sliders filter the entire view, and clicking a hotel
      type filters both Vizz1 and Vizz2.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deposit-type × customer-type heatmap (Vizz2):</strong><br>
      Cells show mean cancellation rate for each combination. Color encodes cancellation
      likelihood, and the view updates based on the selected hotel type and ADR slider range.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Together, these two components support a multilevel examination of how pricing,
    payment commitment, and guest segmentation relate to cancellation risk.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Channels and encodings.</strong><br>
    In Vizz1, horizontal position encodes binned ADR, and vertical position encodes either
    booking count (bars) or cancellation rate (lines). Color encodes hotel type consistently
    across bars and lines, while opacity distinguishes the selected hotel type from the
    non-selected one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Separate/Combined toggle controls bar stacking behavior, switching between overlaid
    and stacked views. The line chart adds point marks at each bin to emphasize cancellation
    values. In Vizz2, the heatmap relies on color intensity to represent cancellation rate,
    with position determined by deposit type × customer type. A unified blue gradient scale
    supports consistent interpretation of low, medium, and high risk.
    ADR sliders act as external filters that constrain the visible ADR domain in both subviews.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Interaction.</strong><br>
    Three main interactions are implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ADR sliders (global filtering):</strong> adjusting the minimum and maximum ADR thresholds recomputes both the histogram + line view and the heatmap using only bookings within the selected ADR range.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotel selection (hotel_sel):</strong> clicking a hotel bar selects that hotel type; both Vizz1 and Vizz2 update to reflect only the selected hotel, and a double-click clears the selection.</li>
    <li><strong>View mode toggle (Separate / Combined):</strong> switches between overlaid and stacked bars, allowing comparison of relative versus absolute frequencies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This combination of global filters, hotel selection, and view mode toggle enables flexible,
    multidimensional exploration of cancellation risk across price levels, deposit types,
    and customer segments while keeping the interface interpretable.
