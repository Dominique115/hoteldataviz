  <h1>View 1 – Booking Timing and Pricing: Lead Time–ADR Relationship Across Guest Segments</h1>

  <p class="note">
    This view focuses on how early guests book (<strong>lead time</strong>) and how much they pay
    (<strong>ADR</strong>), and how this relationship differs by hotel type, customer type,
    and distribution channel.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Analytic question.</strong><br>
    Do guests who book earlier tend to pay more or less (ADR), and does this relationship differ
    by guest type or booking channel?
  </p>

  <p><strong>Low-level tasks.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare the distribution of ADR across different lead times.</li>
    <li>Identify whether the relationship between lead time and ADR changes across hotel types.</li>
    <li>Examine how booking patterns differ across customer types and booking channels.</li>
    <li>Filter and highlight relevant subsets of points to explore patterns interactively.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>View Design</h2>
  <p>
    The view consists of four linked components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A scatter plot of <strong>lead_time vs ADR</strong> with brush selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Trend lines</strong> (one per hotel type) summarizing the overall lead time–ADR pattern.</li>
    <li>A <strong>stacked bar chart</strong> showing distribution channels within each customer type, filtered by the scatter selection.</li>
    <li>A <strong>boxplot</strong> of lead time across customer types.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All components respond to user selections, and checkboxes for <strong>City Hotel</strong> and
    <strong>Resort Hotel</strong> act as global filters.
  </p>

  <h2>Channels and Encodings</h2>
  <p>
    The scatter plot uses position (lead time on the x-axis, ADR on the y-axis) as the primary
    channel to show the booking timing–pricing relationship. Color encodes hotel type and is
    used consistently across scatter points and trend lines. Opacity de-emphasizes points
    outside the current selection, guiding attention to active subsets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trend lines add a derived positional encoding that summarizes the general direction
    of the relationship for each hotel type. The stacked bar chart uses length to represent
    booking counts and color to encode distribution channels. The boxplot uses vertical
    position to compare lead time across customer types, showing variation, median, and spread.
  </p>

  <h2>Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    Two main interactions are implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brush selection on the scatter plot:</strong> dragging across the scatter filters the bar chart; brushed points keep full color and opacity while others fade.</li>
    <li><strong>Point selection on the stacked bar chart:</strong> clicking a bar segment (e.g., “Transient – Direct”) highlights the corresponding points in the scatter plot; other segments remain visible but semi-transparent, supporting multi-selection and comparison.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These interactions create a linked, bidirectional filtering system. Checkbox parameters
    for hotel type provide an additional global filter, updating the scatter, trend lines,
    bar chart, and boxplot simultaneously.
  </p>

  <h2>Critique</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, this view effectively links individual bookings with aggregated patterns.
    The scatter plot and trend lines help reveal how lead time relates to ADR across hotel types.
    The stacked bar chart supports understanding guest segmentation by channel, although
    category imbalances and some overplotting in the scatter can still make comparisons
    slightly challenging. The boxplot adds structural context for booking timing across
    customer types, even though its connection to ADR is indirect.
